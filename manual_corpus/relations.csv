This causes the repelling nature of like-like charges to overcome the forces of attraction in the structure , causing ice to exhibit the unusual characteristic of becoming less dense as it cools , where conventional wisdom declares that the lower the temperature the denser a matter becomes .

5310|down the road|Moment_of|, in its natural state , exists as a liquid . The hydrogen atoms inside the water molecules are not sufficiently close ; hence the hydrogen bonding between the molecules is constantly forming and breaking . This causes water to lack a distinct structure , and gives it its fluid appearance . In its liquid state , a water molecule is on average only hydrogen-bonded to approximately 3.4 neighbouring water molecules at any one time . The density of liquid water is 1.00 g/cubic cm

5312|down the road|Moment_of|is the solid form of water . Ice has a rigid lattice structure , in a tetrahedral crystalline form which resembles giant molecular elements . Its appears in various forms , such as in hard amalgamated crystals like ice cubes , or loosely accumulated granules like in snow . Unlike liquid water , hydrogen bonding plays a stronger role in the density and shape of ice than the covalent bonds as the water molecules are pressed against each other very closely . This causes the repelling nature of like-like charges to overcome the forces of attraction in the structure , causing ice to exhibit the unusual characteristic of becoming less dense as it cools , where conventional wisdom declares that the lower the temperature the denser a matter becomes . The density of ice is 0.931 g/cubic cm

Those who belong to the middle and upper classes were mostly dedicated to progressivism . This also includes the highly urbanized regions . Politicians also liked the idea of progressivism and highlighted charitable acts . It was a top - to - bottom approach where ideas mainly originated from the top tier and then later spread to the masses . Progressivists , as how they were called , moved for scientific advancement and societal perfection

It is a down - up movement , which suggests more involvement of the masses with regard to the procurement of ideas and also with important decision - making . It is in this light that popular social groups or organizations for the masses were formed like the Grange and Farmers ’ Alliance

5322|down the road|Moment_of|The other notable difference between security and safety is that is the protection against deliberate threats while safety is the aspect of being secure against unintended threats . People and properties are usually protected against deliberate threats that are caused by criminals who have the intention to sabotage the operations of the company , steal resources of the organization , or harm an individual . This means that security is geared towards the protection against criminal activities that are perpetuated by criminals
